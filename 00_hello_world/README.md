# hello_world

So, you managed to install everything and now are eager to try your hands on the
real stuff. You are in the right place!

The validator in this task simply locks given ADA and you have to provide the
correct password to unlock it. However, something is wrong and the unlocking of
the funds fails with an error:

```
error: Uncaught (in promise) "Redeemer (Spend, 0): The provided Plutus code called 'error'.\n\nExBudget {\n    mem: 21485,\n    cpu: 8262844,\n}\n\n"
```

This error means that the validator does not validate your transaction. Can you
find out why and unlock the funds?

## How to solve the challenges

Each challenge consists of 2 files that you should interact with:

- The validator, located in
  [validators/hello_world.ak](./validators/hello_world.ak)
- The off-chain code, located in
  [scripts/player_template.ts](./scripts/player_template.ts)

The validator code is read only — you are not supposed to modify it, you are
supposed to exploit it. The off-chain is divided into 3 parts:

1. Setup — this part setups the vulnerable scenario. This means deploying the
   smart contracts, minting NFTs if needed, ... You should not make changes to
   this part of the file. Setup is done by calling the `setup` function from
   [task.ts](./scripts/task.ts).
2. Interaction part — this is the only part that you need to edit. All your
   exploits should go here. Usually, this part already includes an example
   interaction which can get you going faster but is not sufficient just yet.
   This code interacts with the smart contract in some way, but does not exploit
   the vulnerability. This part is located in the
   [player_template.ts](./scripts/player_template.ts) file. To play, we
   recommend keeping the template as is and **copying it** into a file called
   `player.ts` which you can then freely edit.
3. Tests — the tests verify whether you correctly achieved your goal. Tests are
   done by calling the `test` function from the [task.ts](./scripts/task.ts). Do
   not modify this part.

   Note: It may be possible to satisfy the tests by not exploiting the contract
   the way it was intended to. Especially later in the more complex scenarios,
   there may be multiple paths to achieve the same goal. If you think you came
   up with a unique attack, [drop us a line](../README.md#feedback). We would
   love to hear about that!

The above parts communicate through a structure called `GameData`. It is created
during the setup, and it contains everything you need for solving the challenges
and everything that the tests require. You should not modify it. The tests may
require additional info contained within a `TestData` structure. You will be
specifically instructed on how to modify it if needed. It is not needed for this
task.

To start, you can compile the validators by running `aiken build` in the root of
the task. Then you can run the sample code by running
`deno run --allow-net --allow-read ./scripts/run.ts`. Run is our wrapper that
calls the function `play` from `player.ts` (if you did not copy
`player_template.ts`, it will not work).

The wrapper first tests your code in the Lucid emulator. If all the tests inside
the emulator pass, the code is tested one more time against the testnet. The
emulator provides early feedback so that you do not need to wait for all the
transactions being validated and accepted on the actual blockchain. Once you
solve the task, though, only the testnet offers a real-world environment and so
it is really important to pass there as well. This default behavior can be
changed in the `common/offchain/config.ts`.

The goal of each task is to pass all the tests by editing the editable parts of
off-chain code. You will get a _green_ congrats message once you get there.

With all that said, good luck and have fun!
