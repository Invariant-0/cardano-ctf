# Videos

This folder contains videos that explain the framework and the tasks. Generally,
it should be enough to read the READMEs. However, if you prefer watching the
videos, it may get you up to speed faster.

The first video [00_hello_world.mp4](./00_hello_world.mp4) explains the
framework and solves the initial task. As such, it contains spoilers and so we
do not recommend watching it unless you are struggling. Alternatively, you can
check it after you solve the task yourself.

For the rest of the videos, we try to not spoil too much of the fun. However,
for best results we recommend referring to the videos just as a form of a
troubleshooting guide.
